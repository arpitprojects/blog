As a document-oriented database, MongoDB is a more
generalized NoSQL solution.

Set up the system.

- Download the msi file.

note : Don’t execute anything just yet,
but know that MONGOD is the server process and MONGO is the client shell.

- got to c:programfiles/mongodb/server/3.4/bin/

-add a mongod.config file

-dbpath=c:/xampp/htdocs/mongo

-and then on c:/programfiles/..../bin mongod --config path to config files.

-c:/programfiles/..../bin mongo

2.)Within a MongoDB instance you can have zero or more databases, each acting as high-level
containers for everything else

3.) A collection shares enough in common with a traditional table
that you can safely think of the two as the same thing.

4.)Collections are made up of zero or more documents. Again, a document can safely be thought of as a row

5.)A document is made up of one or more fields, which you can probably guess are a lot like columns

In sql table > rows > columns

in mongo collections > documents > fields.

6.)commands db.help();
db.stats() tells what all of the file and collections are there.

7.)mongo shell runs on javascript so, always put () after the function otherwise you will get the body.

8.)db.unicorns.insert({name: 'Aurora',
gender: 'f', weight: 450});

Bson - binary serialized json format.


9.) You can now use the find command against unicorns to return a list of documents:
db.unicorns.find()
to get all the rows / documents.

10.)db.unicorns.insert({name: 'Leto',
12
gender: 'm',
home: 'Arrakeen',
worm: false})

db.unicorns.find() - you will see two different rows.

11.)to remove db.name.remove({});
